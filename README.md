# ü§ñ The Fair Grader: A Hybrid AI Grading Assistant

**The Fair Grader** is a full-stack web application that leverages the power of the **Gemini API** for intelligent grading and feedback, combined with a local **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** algorithm for objective content similarity scoring.

It allows users to upload images (handwritten or digital) or paste text for a Question Paper, an Official Answer Key, and a Student's Answer Sheet. The Gemini model handles OCR, data structuring, and nuanced grading based on a user-selected 'persona' (e.g., Strict, Insightful, Custom), while the frontend calculates a content similarity score for a balanced, hybrid evaluation.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Hybrid Grading:** Get a subjective, personalized AI Grade (0-10) and an objective TF-IDF Similarity Score (0.0-1.0).
* **Multimodal Input:** Accept image uploads (for OCR of handwritten or printed documents) or plain text for the Question Paper, Model Answer, and Student Answer.
* **Customizable Personas:** Select from preset grading profiles (**Balanced, Strict, Mentor**) or create a **Custom Persona** with specific instructions for the AI.
* **Structured Data Extraction:** The Gemini model automatically extracts and structures questions and answers from mixed text/image inputs.
* **Simple Setup:** Uses a lightweight Flask backend and a modern JavaScript/Tailwind CSS frontend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository consists of a standard Flask application structure:
## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get **The Fair Grader** running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**
2.  **A Gemini API Key:** You can get one from [Google AI Studio].
3.  **Basic understanding of Flask and JavaScript.**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-link]
    cd the-fair-grader
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the necessary Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask google-genai
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to the address shown in your terminal.

3.  **Use the App:**
    * Click **"Get Started"** to access the main grading page.
    * **Enter your Gemini API Key** in the dedicated input field. The key is sent securely to the backend for processing each request and is **not stored**.
    * Upload/paste the **Question Paper**, **Official Answer Key**, and **Student's Answer Sheet**.
    * Select your **Grader Profile**.
    * Click **"Grade Answers"**.

## üß† Core Hybrid Logic

The grading process follows a 4-step hybrid approach orchestrated between the frontend (`script.js`) and the backend (`app.py`):

1.  **Backend (Gemini Extraction):**
    * The backend uses the **`gemini-2.5-pro`** model to perform **OCR and data extraction** on the Question Paper and Official Answer Key.
    * It extracts them into a structured JSON `questionBank: [{"id": "Q1", "question": "...", "model_answer": "..."}]`.

2.  **Backend (Gemini Grading):**
    * The backend then uses the **`gemini-2.5-pro`** model again, providing the `questionBank`, the student's answer input (image/text), and the `personaInstructions`.
    * The model returns a JSON evaluation including a **`grade`** (0-10), **`feedback`**, and the **`extracted_answer`** for comparison.

3.  **Frontend (TF-IDF Calculation):**
    * The frontend's `script.js` contains a re-implementation of the **TF-IDF algorithm** (`calculateTfidfSimilarity` function).
    * Once the grading results are received, the frontend calculates the **Similarity Score** by comparing the `extracted_answer` (from the AI) and the `model_answer` (from the `questionBank`).

4.  **Display Results:**
    * The UI displays both the **AI Grade** and the **Similarity Score**, providing the user with a comprehensive, hybrid view of the student's performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3, Flask
* **AI:** Google Gemini API (`google-genai` library)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript (with custom TF-IDF), Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
